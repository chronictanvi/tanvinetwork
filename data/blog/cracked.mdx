Ruben Pater writes about Fordism, Taylorism, how capitalism desires humans to constantly reinvent themselves. Even if the market is in XYZ condition it falls on you to fix your portfolio, etc. Not that you shouldn't do those things, but recognising that there are larger forces at play here. 

The tech industry describes these as 10x — now cracked designers. 




I've been looking for a role for a while. My previous role ended in a bad way, the work was exploitatitve. New York city is a 'at will employment' state which basically means you can get fired for any reason. You can't of course be fired if you're a member of a protected group — like disabled, but proving that you were fired because you're diabled requires lawyers, and patience and energy to interact with and relieve your trauma. The USA prides itself on justice through litigation but after having been in positions where the way to get remediation or justice is through the court system, I've found myself overwhelmed  at the thought of going through that proccess, knowing that it could end up being a conclusion that might make me feel worse. 

When I brought this up to the HR at my previous employer she said "and do you really want to work for a place that wants to fire you?" I've not chosen to be public with this because I was (righlty) advised to not burn bridges. But after some thought, wasn't it the person who fired me who burnt bridges in the first place? Why is it that the people who have been harmed hestitate to come forward especially in situations of work place mismanagememt because it might affect future employers? 

For the longest time I didn't have any money, or stable status in the US and therefore would just accept whatever was on my plate because I didn't have a choice. I didn't have a choice to not work for AI startups or abusive managers et al but now I do, maybe.
