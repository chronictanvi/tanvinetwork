## About
### Tanvi is a design technologist operating at the intersection of data, aesthetics, and the humanities. 

Hi! I'm a Design Researcher at Emory University, contributing to Data by Design: A History in Five Charts, set to be published by MIT Press in 2025. I'm also a Producer at BIPOC Design History. Previously, I have worked with Giorgia Lupi’s team at Pentagram, Public Policy Lab, and Spotify. I live in Brooklyn with my two cats, Yuchi and Bubbles.
