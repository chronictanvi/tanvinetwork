## About
### Tanvi is a design technologist operating at the intersection of data, aesthetics, and the humanities. 

Hi! I'm (most recently) a Designer with Giorgia Lupi’s team at Pentagram and a Design Researcher at Emory University, contributing to Data by Design: A History in Five Charts, set to be published by MIT Press in 2025. Previously, I have worked with Polymode, Public Policy Lab, Spotify and Apple Music. I live in Brooklyn with my two cats, Yuchi and Bubbles.
