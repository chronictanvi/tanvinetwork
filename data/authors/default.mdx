# Hello!
## I’m a design technologist committed to creating progressive and interdisciplinary experiences.

 I strive to explore alternative ways of understanding the convergence of the social experience, aesthetics & language. When I’m not designing, I’m reading and gardening with my peers to build solidarity and thoughtfulness. I live in Downtown Brooklyn, NY. 

I occasionally write on blog.tanvi.network.
